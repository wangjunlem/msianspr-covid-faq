1. Open the MySejahtera app. Register / login if you haven't done so.
1. Select "Home" -> "Helpdesk".
1. Select "N. I have received my vaccination overseas and would like to obtain my digital certificate in MySejahtera"
1. Follow the instructions given in the prompt.
  - When asked for IC, please enter your Malaysian NRIC.
  - Responses to the fields should match your vaccine certificate.
  - In some cases, uploading a PDF may fail. You may want to take a screenshot of your certificate.

Vaccine records may take up to 2 weeks to be updated.

## Singapore

You need to be in Singapore physically to update your vaccine records.

1. Find any clinic that provides serology testing for Covid-19 antibodies.
1. Visit the clinic with the following items:
    - Vaccination certificate (physical or digital/MySejahtera), in English
    - Document of identity
        - NRIC for Singapore citizens and PRs
        - FIN for LTVP / WP / SP / EP / DP / STP holders
        - Passport for visitor pass holders staying > 30 days
1. Complete the serology test

If the serology test result is positive, your vaccine records will be updated on TraceTogether and HealthHub. 

You may check the result of your serology test on HealthHub within 1-2 working days. The update on TraceTogether may take longer - check with your clinic.
