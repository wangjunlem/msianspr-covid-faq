## Technical Details

This website is built speedily based on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which in turn supports [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) themes. The theme I have used is [bulma-clean-theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme), which is built with the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) framework.

In order to run this yourself or test any changes that you'll make, there are two methods:

### Remote (GitHub Pages)

This requires minimal set-up and is powered by GitHub's own system. You should fork this repo, and then set up GitHub Pages. Point it to your working branch. Any changes will be reflected on GitHub itself.

Please remember to do a Pull Request to merge your charges back into the [parent repo](https://github.com/wangjunlem/msianspr-covid-faq/).

### Local

This is more complex, and you will first have to set up Ruby and Jekyll. Documentation can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Subsequently, in the folder root, run `bundle install`.

You will then have to switch the commenting in `_config.yml` to use a locally-installed theme instead of the remote theme, like so:

```
theme: bulma-clean-theme
# remote_theme: wangjunlem/bulma-clean-theme
```

Then, use `bundle exec jekyll serve` in order to get your local up and running.
