## Travelling: Singapore ⇾ Malaysia (non-PCA)

### What do I need to do to exit Singapore?

There are no restrictions for exiting Singapore. The official travel advisory by MOH is to defer all travel to Malaysia. The latest advisory can be found [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19).

Please verify that your Re-entry Permit (REP) is still valid before exiting Singapore. Additionally, please ensure that you have a digital copy of your REP on your phone or in cloud storage.

Regarding the issue of myPASS for travel to Malaysia, if you are travelling:

- by land

    ICA should not be asking for a myPASS. If they do, inform them that the Malaysian side will not ask for myPASS on entry.

- by air

    Airlines and immigration authorities may ask you to show your [myPASS/Travel Note](#is-applying-for-mypass-travel-note-still-necessary) because they liaise with the Malaysian High Comm. To be safe, please apply.

### What do I need to do to enter Malaysia?

You will need to print out, fill in, and sign a [Letter of Undertaking](http://www.nadma.gov.my/images/nadma/documents/garispanduan/LATEST_LOU.pdf) stating that you agree to pay any quarantine costs applicable (accommodation and Covid-19 test). 

At least 3 working days before entering, you should also: 

1. download MySejahtera
2. fill in the form located at [this](#qr-code-for-nadma-registration) QR code
3. make payment for all costs (accommodation, swab test, operational costs if foreigner) at [MySafeTravel](https://safetravel.myeg.com.my) _* note - this is not recommended for now due to rule changes to MCO_
4. ~~apply for a [myPASS](https://mypass.mhc.org.sg/)/Travel Note from the High Commission of Malaysia~~ _(practically optional, see [note below](#is-applying-for-mypass-travel-note-still-necessary))_

If you are entering the country with non-Malaysian citizen(s) (e.g. your spouse or children who holds non-Malaysian citizenship, and including those with Malaysian PR), see below: [What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Malaysia?](#what-if-my-spouse-children-are-going-over-with-me-to-malaysia)

If you are entering Sabah or Sarawak, please take note of the latest SOPs found on [this page](https://hednp.sabah.gov.my). Take note that non-Sabahans may need approval to enter the state; see more details [here](https://phednp.wixsite.com/website). Fill in the Health Declaration Form [here](http://sm.jknsabah.gov.my/HDF/hdf.php) within 12 hours of your arrival. 

If you are entering Sarawak, please take note of the latest SOPs found on [this page](https://sarawakdisastermc.com/). If you meet the requirements, you will need to [apply for enterSarawak](https://entersarawak.socoe.co/register) and fill in the Health Declaration Form [here](https://ms.microweb.my/) within 12 hours of your arrival.


### How can I enter Malaysia from Singapore via the land checkpoints? 

If you have your own vehicle (car/motorcycle), you may head to either checkpoint during their operating hours.

Otherwise, you may only enter via BSI/Woodlands. You may choose to walk across the Causeway. 

Alternatively, you may use the shuttle bus arranged by the Johor government, chargeable at S$1 (note: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannot</span> be paid with RM3, no change provided). They operate hourly from 7.30am to 6.30pm (except 1.30pm for lunch break). See [here](https://www.facebook.com/officialpaj/posts/3930626316950618) for timetable.

Take note of the operating hours at each checkpoint in Malaysia (BSI operates from 7am to 7pm; KSAB operates from 8am to 12am for light vehicles). The Singapore checkpoints operate 24 hours a day.


### What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Malaysia? 

If you are entering Malaysia with non-citizen(s) including those holding Malaysia PR, then you will need to apply for [MyTravelPass](https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/main?) for them to enter the country at least 5 working days before your journey. Please submit your application only once until there is a response on your application.

Additionally, foreigners must make payment for the accommodation and operational costs using [MySafeTravel](https://safetravel.myeg.com.my) before entering Malaysia, or they will be denied entry. Payment cannot be made on the spot.


### Who do I need to put as Witness on my Letter of Undertaking (LoU)? 

There is no need. It will be filled in when you arrive at the checkpoint.


### I am not leaving on the day stated on the myPASS/MyTravelPass/MySafeTravel, do I need to re-apply? 

The validity period will be stated on the document that you have applied for, including for any other travellers following you. 

Please re-apply for the passes if you are not travelling within the stated validity period(s).


### Is applying for myPASS/Travel Note still necessary? 

So far, most anecdotes show that both Singaporean and Malaysian authorities do not check if you have a myPASS/Travel Note before exiting Singapore and entering Malaysia respectively. Separately, [JIM has confirmed](#response-from-jim-regarding-mc-spr-exiting-malaysia) that there is no restriction of entry into Malaysia as a Malaysian citizen.

However, the directive to apply myPASS is given by the MHC, and airlines may still ask for a valid myPASS before travel.

If you want to err on the side of caution, you may apply. In the event of emergency travel or if you have not received your myPASS before you travel, the recommendation at the moment is to travel regardless and explain your situation to the authorities (if needed) that Malaysian citizens are not barred from re-entering Malaysia using the [JIM confirmation](#response-from-jim-regarding-mc-spr-exiting-malaysia) and [this news article](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2020/12/28/malaysians-abroad-cannot-be-prevented-from-returning-says-ismail-sabri/1935587).


### Is there anything to do/note before entering Malaysia on the day of my travel? 

All travellers are now <span style="text-decoration:underline;">strongly</span> recommended to make payment for their accommodation, swab tests, and operational costs (for foreigners) with [MySafeTravel](https://safetravel.myeg.com.my/) before entering the country.

You may also want to do a pre-departure swab test. See [here](#do-i-need-to-do-a-swab-test-before-entering-malaysia).

If you are a Malaysian citizen and choose not to pay in advance, please make sure you have sufficient cash with you to pay for all prevailing charges, especially the swab test which is payable by cash upon arrival (to be safe, bring at least RM400). Credit cards may not be accepted at checkpoints.

Bring along the following with you:

1. a pen
2. a thermometer
3. a digital/physical copy of valid SPR Re-entry Permit (REP)
4. the MySafeTravel receipt(s)/QR code(s) (if payment was made ahead of time)
5. cash of at least RM400 (if payment not made ahead of time)
6. a printed and signed Letter of Undertaking (LoU) (optional, can be filled on arrival)

Do not worry if you don’t have a MyPass, see: [Is applying for myPASS/Travel Note still necessary?](#is-applying-for-mypass-travel-note-still-necessary)

If you are travelling in via the land checkpoints, make sure that you are expected to reach the checkpoints while they are open. For BSI, the operating hours are 7am to 7pm; for KSAB, the operating hours are 8am to 12am. See also: [How can I enter Malaysia from Singapore via the land checkpoints?](#how-can-i-enter-malaysia-from-singapore-via-the-land-checkpoints)

You may want to pack some (dry) food for consumption while going through the procedures and during hotel quarantine.

Do not bring: 



1. drugs (unless for medical purposes - it’s recommended to bring along a doctor’s note/prescription)
2. drinking alcohol
3. cigarettes
4. sharp items

They will be confiscated by the team during bag checks and there is no guarantee that the items will be returned to you in their original condition.


### Do I need to do a swab test before entering Malaysia?

If you’re going back as a normal returning Malaysian, it is not mandatory to do a swab test; you will be swabbed on entry into Malaysia and be quarantined for 10 days.

However, if you complete an RT-PCR (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> RTK antigen) swab test within 72 hours before departure to Malaysia, you will skip the arrival swab and have your quarantine shortened to 7 days. See [here](#how-much-will-the-quarantine-cost) for costs and [here](#how-many-days-is-the-quarantine-going-to-be) for explanation and sources. 

For those returning from Singapore, you can find a list of RT-PCR swab test providers [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providers).


### What are the procedures I can expect after entering Malaysia? 

At arrival, you will be cleared for immigration. You will also submit your LoU (if you’ve forgotten to bring it along, you can sign a copy on the spot). 

You will then be brought to a testing centre at fixed intervals. Those travelling in their own vehicles (car/motorcycle/van/…) will be escorted by police. For those entering via the land checkpoints by foot or public transport at BSI, there will be trips to the testing centre via bus at the same time.

At the testing centre, you will be swabbed and asked to wait for your test results. You may be informed that you can order food delivery services to the location.

If your test results are negative, you will then be brought to the hotel for check-in procedures. There, if you have not paid using [MySafeTravel](https://safetravel.myeg.com.my), you will pay for the prevailing hotel charges (currently at RM150/night), payable by credit card.

The total duration from arrival at immigration to hotel check-in can take anywhere from 5 hours up to 12 hours. Please prepare sufficient water, snacks, medication, etc.


### How much will the quarantine cost? 

For normal accommodation, it will cost RM150/night.

Non-Malaysians also have to pay a fixed administrative cost of RM2600/person.

Additional charges may apply if you opt for premium accommodation.

For swab tests, you will be swabbed a day or two before the end of quarantine. 

Those who have done a pre-departure RT-PCR swab test within 72 hours before departure to Malaysia will not be required to do an arrival swab (on the condition that they do not show any symptoms).

### How many days is the quarantine going to be? 

7 days if you have done a pre-departure RT-PCR swab test within 72 hours before departure to Malaysia. (You will also skip the arrival swab if you do not show any symptoms; see [here](https://www.facebook.com/MajlisKeselamatanNegara/posts/3003689579733928).)

Otherwise, 10 days.


### How do I know the last date of my quarantine? 

Follow the date on the wristband.


### Can I choose which hotel to stay in? 

You may put in a request with [APM](#what-do-the-acronyms-mean) on the day of your arrival for your choice of hotel/room if:



1. You are returning in your own vehicle (i.e. not public transport); and
2. You have made prior arrangements (enquiry & booking, not payment) with the hotel of your choice.

On the day of your arrival, show the booking confirmation from the hotel to the APM officer on site (not JIM or MOH personnel) to show that they are willing to check you in.

See the known quarantine stations [here](#last-known-hotels-for-quarantine-in-malaysia). All arrangements are subject to hotel availability, and additional charges may apply depending on the location.


### Can I get food or personal items delivered to/from my hotel via Grab or by family members? 

The SOPs on delivery differ from hotel to hotel. You are advised to check with the hotel directly.

The common SOP known is that for food delivery, only fast food is allowed. Home cooked food will not be allowed unless special approval is given by MOH (e.g. health reasons). 

For personal belongings (e.g. clothes), **please only do so if it is urgent and necessary. Hotel workers are swamped with these requests. **Family members can bring it over; however, you are not allowed to hand over any items (including any perishables and souvenirs) back to your family members or friends.


### Are there laundry services at my hotel? 

You are to stay in your room at all times. In general, most reports have said that laundry services are not provided. You may opt to do your own washing in your room.


### Can I choose to quarantine at home? 

No, all returning Malaysians will have to quarantine at designated hotels.

If there are non-life-threatening medical conditions, you may inform the officers on site to request for special arrangements. Medical officers are on site 24/7 at the quarantine stations.

If there are truly extenuating circumstances (e.g. people requiring long term care or constant monitoring), you may apply for special consideration, however note that the success rate is (understandably) low. 

Please refer to guidelines on requesting for exemptions: [Emailing MOH MY for Special Consideration of Hotel Quarantine Exemption](#emailing-moh-my-for-special-consideration-of-hotel-quarantine-exemption)


### Can I be exempted from paying the quarantine fees? 

You will be exempted from paying the quarantine fees if you fall into categories below. The forms can be printed and filled in ahead of time [here](http://covid-19.moh.gov.my/garis-panduan/garis-panduan-pengecualian-caj-kuarantin-bagi-person-under-surveilence-pus-di-stesen-kuarantin) (advised to do so), or can be obtained at the counters after you arrive.

If you require special consideration for exemption of quarantine fees due to either:



1. being stuck in another country and have exhausted your funds; or
2. loss of employment (e.g. due to retrenchment)

You may fill in Form E ahead of time found [here](http://covid-19.moh.gov.my/garis-panduan/garis-panduan-pengecualian-caj-kuarantin-bagi-person-under-surveilence-pus-di-stesen-kuarantin), and submit the form and all supporting documents to [pengecualicovid@moh.gov.my](mailto:pengecualicovid@moh.gov.my) for approval by the Finance Department of MOH MY.

The full memo from the Sec-Gen of MOH MY (in Bahasa Malaysia), including all forms and the flowchart for payment exemptions can be found [here](http://covid-19.moh.gov.my/garis-panduan/garis-panduan-pengecualian-caj-kuarantin-bagi-person-under-surveilence-pus-di-stesen-kuarantin/Panduan_Pengecualian_Kos_Kuarantin_PUS_KKM.pdf).


### I exited Malaysia before 18 March 2020 (first day of MCO). Can I still enter Malaysia now? 

Yes, there are no longer restrictions for entering or reentering Malaysia.


### There is an active MCO/PKP at my point of entry, can I still go back? 

Yes, you can. If you are travelling onwards to other districts outside of your quarantine location, please see below on instructions for travelling _after_ quarantine has ended.


### I would like to travel to another state/district after my quarantine ends (e.g. quarantine in Selangor after entering KLIA, but my hometown is in Perak). Can I do so? 

Yes, you can. From 7th December onwards until 12th January, travelling between areas of RMCO/CMCO is allowed without a permit; however, restrictions on EMCO/TEMCO areas apply.

For those travelling from 13th January onwards:

Take note that inter-state travel is not allowed for the whole country, and states under MCO will not allow inter-district travel. See: [Known Areas Affected By MCO](#known-areas-affected-by-mco)

_PENDING CONFIRMATION._ You will have to apply for a movement permit using the form [here](https://www.rmp.gov.my/docs/default-source/Penerbitan/borang-permit-pergerakan-pkpb.pdf?sfvrsn=2) at the nearest police station. Please send to your friends/relatives the photos of:



1. the Quarantine Order document given to you at the start of the quarantine
2. (If applying last minute) the _Surat Pelepasan_

as supporting documents for their movement permit application to fetch you.

Your family/friends who will pick you up will then carry the letter when they pick you up from the quarantine station at the end of your quarantine.


## Travelling: Malaysia ⇾ Singapore (non-PCA) 


### What do I need to do to exit Malaysia? 

If you are a SPR and travelling alone or with other long-term pass holders, you will have to show your long-term pass(es) - SG NRIC or FIN - to the immigration officers. Please also prepare a copy of your REP in case they ask for it. 

You do not need a MyTravelPass at the moment (see [announcement (video) by DGI](https://youtu.be/oRNEHKjrel4?t=323), [JIM FB post](https://www.facebook.com/imigresen/posts/3576029612463468), [response from enquiry to MyTravelPass](#response-from-jim-regarding-mc-spr-exiting-malaysia)); however, please check official sources before your travel date to ensure that this is still true on the date of your departure. If in doubt and if you have time, it is recommended to apply for [MyTravelPass](https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/main?) approval 5 working days before your date of departure.

Note that holding SPR In-Principle Approval (IPA) does not constitute being a PR, so you will need to apply for a MyTravelPass to exit.

If you are travelling with others, see: [What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Singapore?](#what-if-my-spouse-children-are-going-over-with-me-to-singapore)


### What do I need to do to enter Singapore? 

You will need to submit a [Health Declaration](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/) up to 3 days before your arrival in Singapore.

You will need to pay for your swab test (up to $200 including GST). Payment will not be made at the border; register and follow the instructions [here](https://go.gov.sg/covid19test). You will be informed of the date of your swab test later.

If you are entering Singapore with a non-SC/non-SPR, please ensure that they have approval from the relevant authorities for entry into Singapore. See the ICA page for more information [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/enteringsg). 

From 27 November 2020 onwards, to enter Singapore, non-SC/non-SPR travellers will also require a valid negative RT-PCR COVID-19 swab test within 72 hours before departure to Singapore. See [press release](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updated-border-measures-for-travellers-from-malaysia-and-japan) and [info sheet](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) for more details.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If you are entering Singapore before 22 November 2020, 2359hrs:</span>

If you left Singapore after 27 March 2020 and/or you are renting a place, you may need to arrange for accommodation to serve your SHN. See: [Can I serve my SHN at my residence in Singapore?](#can-i-serve-my-shn-at-my-residence-in-singapore)


### How can I enter Singapore from Malaysia via the land checkpoints? 

If you have your own vehicle (car/motorcycle), you may head to either checkpoint during their operating hours.

Otherwise, you may only enter via Woodlands/BSI. You may choose to walk across the Causeway. 

Alternatively, you may use the shuttle bus arranged by the Johor government, chargeable at RM1.50 (no change provided). They operate hourly from 7am to 6pm (except 1pm for lunch break). See [here](https://www.facebook.com/officialpaj/posts/3930626316950618) for timetable.

Take note of the operating hours at each checkpoint in Malaysia (BSI operates from 7am to 7pm; KSAB operates from 8am to 12am for light vehicles). The Singapore checkpoints operate 24 hours a day.


### I entered Malaysia after 18 March 2020 (first day of MCO). Can I still exit Malaysia now? 

Yes, with the condition that you hold a valid Singapore PR or long-term pass. Otherwise, you will need to apply for approval to exit the country via [MyTravelPass](https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/main?).

_You are strongly advised to not abuse this, please, and to only travel if absolutely necessary._


### Can I serve my SHN at my residence in Singapore? 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If you are entering Singapore after 22 November 2020, 2359hrs:</span>

No. You must serve a [14-day SHN](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updated-border-measures-for-travellers-from-malaysia-and-japan) at a SHN dedicated facility, including any RGL travellers. For normal travellers, all prevailing costs for tests and accommodation apply. (If you are travelling under RGL, please check with the authorities, but the likelihood is that you will have to pay for the prevailing costs as well.)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If you are entering Singapore before 22 November 2020, 2359hrs:</span>

If you have a travel history to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sabah</span> in the last 14 days and are entering Singapore after 14th Oct 2359hrs, no, you must serve it at a SHN dedicated facility for 14 days. You will bear the full payment if you have left Singapore from 27 March 2020 onwards.

The SG government’s stance is that you are strongly encouraged to have a dedicated room and toilet in your residence while serving your SHN, and minimise contact with other residents/tenants.

If you are renting a room/unit, please ensure that the landlord/other tenants are agreeable to your SHN, as they may have to report this to their own companies. If there are disagreements, you are advised to arrange for your own SHN accommodation.

Some suggestions for SHN accommodation can be found in the appendix: [Hotels for Serving Stay-Home Notice](#hotels-for-serving-stay-home-notice)


### What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Singapore? 

If you are exiting the country with Malaysian citizen(s) who do not qualify for any approval exemptions listed in the JIM memo [here](https://www.facebook.com/imigresen/posts/3525366314196465) (latest as of 7th October 2020; please check JIM page in case this becomes outdated), then you will need to apply for [MyTravelPass](https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/main?) for them to exit the country at least 5 working days before your journey. Include all relevant supporting documents - your SPR NRIC and reentry permit, marriage/birth certificates, and an appeal letter at the bare minimum. Please submit your application only once until there is a response on your application.

You will also need to [submit an appeal](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e3648e9405c180011dc5f9c) to ICA for entry to Singapore for people not holding SPR. From 27 November 2020 onwards, non-SC/non-SPR travellers will also require a valid negative COVID-19 to enter Singapore. See [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updated-border-measures-for-travellers-from-malaysia-and-japan) for more details.

When exiting Malaysia, the current rule is that you (as the SPR) must exit together with any travellers under 12 who have gained the special approval on MyTravelPass.


### Is there anything to do/note before I enter Singapore? 

Please remember to keep all receipts during your SHN, including any taxi rides, as they might be needed for contact tracing if your swab test returns a positive result.

Please ensure that you have a thermometer with you to monitor your health during SHN.

There is a regular hourly bus offered by the Johor government. See [here](#how-can-i-enter-singapore-from-malaysia-via-the-land-checkpoints).

All related costs (tests, SHN, medical fees if any) will no longer be waived by the Singapore government if you enter after 1 January 2021. See [here](https://www.gov.sg/article/cost-of-shn-stays-swab-tests-and-medical-expenses-when-you-travel) for the latest updates on cost, and [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-to-stay-home-notice-and-charging-policy-for-travellers) for the change in policy.

You may want to download TraceTogether and/or SingPass, as well as the StayHome@SG app.

If you are driving into, or passing through any districts/states with any form of MCO in effect, please apply for a movement permit using the form [here](https://www.rmp.gov.my/docs/default-source/Penerbitan/borang-permit-pergerakan-pkpb.pdf?sfvrsn=2) at the nearest police station. This applies to travellers departing from KLIA/KLIA2 as well. See: [Known Areas Affected By MCO](#known-areas-affected-by-mco) 


### What should I expect about checks during my SHN? 

This section is no longer relevant if you enter after 23 November 2020 until further notice.

You may be called to confirm that you are at your SHN location. Most commonly, personnel contracted by MOH will call you via WhatsApp and request that you turn on your camera to show your surrounding area, the wristband being worn correctly, and the gateway is turned on.

There is also the possibility of random checks conducted in-person.

See ICA’s page [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn), enforcement checks section.


### How long is the SHN going to be? 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If you are entering Singapore after 22 November 2020, 2359hrs:</span>

14 days at a SHN dedicated facility. See [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updated-border-measures-for-travellers-from-malaysia-and-japan) for the latest update.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If you are entering Singapore before 22 November 2020, 2359hrs:</span>

If you have a travel history to Sabah within the last 14 days, it is 14 days at SHN dedicated facilities if you enter after 14th Oct, 2359hrs. See [here](https://www.facebook.com/sghealthministry/posts/10158568207415631) for the latest update.

Otherwise, it is 7 days.

If you have travel history outside of Malaysia, please refer to the ICA site [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/arrivalsg) for the latest guidelines.


### How much will the entirety of the SHN cost? 

For staying at a SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF), it will cost $2000 per person. If you are sharing the room with another person (limited to family members and subject to approval), the cost will be $1300 per person.

If you have children, they may qualify for reduced charges depending on their age. You can appeal to ICA via the hotel in which you are serving your SHN; the hotel manager on duty will forward the appeal.

For the swab test, it will cost less than $200 per person. (Last known price: $125)


### What happens to my vehicle if I’m driving in? 

You will not be parking the car at the SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF). Instead, you will have to drive to a car park you have arranged beforehand (e.g. HDB/condo), and then head to the SDF.

There have been instances of escort officers and vehicles that will follow you to the car park and then bring you back to the SDF, There are also stories of being given a tracker, heading to the car park yourself, and then getting a taxi back to the SDF. Please follow the instructions of the officers on the day itself.


### When is my swab test? 

You will be contacted via SMS and phone regarding your swab test up to 2 days before the actual day of the swab test. From experience, the swab test will take place 3-4 days before the end of your SHN.


### When and where can I check my swab test results? 

Your swab test result will be available on [HealthHub](https://eservices.healthhub.sg/PersonalHealth/CovidLabResults) within 24 hours of the test. You will also be contacted by phone.


### What happens at the end of my SHN? 

First, please verify the end date of your SHN using the calculator provided [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn) at the end of the page.

You can leave your accommodation after 12pm on the last day of your SHN, but only if your Covid-19 test results are out.


### Do I throw away the wristband and gateway at the end of my SHN? 

You can throw away the wristband after the end of SHN.

There will be arrangements made to collect the gateway one day before the end of your SHN.


## Travelling with PCA


### Does the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) apply to us SPRs?

Yes, if you are employed by a company. Please consult with your company’s HR on the exact procedures.


### What are the travel requirements, conditions, restrictions?

You must travel in and out via the land borders (i.e. Woodlands/BSI and Tuas/KSAB).

While waiting for your swab test results on entry to Malaysia, you must have a place of residence in the state of Johor, if not, you will need to arrange for a hotel room to stay. If your Malaysia IC does not reflect it, please show proof of residence (e.g. bank statements or bills).

You can be out of Singapore for up to 60 days per PCA application, and will have to be back in Singapore for another 90 days before you can submit another PCA application.

The total number of PCA travellers per day is subject to a daily quota (unknown number). Please make arrangements with your employer ahead of time.


### I am self-employed/unemployed. Am I allowed to apply for PCA?

No. The application for PCA requires the company to apply for you with a CorpPass account.


### Do I need to quarantine after returning from Singapore to Malaysia?

You will need to quarantine for the first 3 days while waiting for results. During this time, even if you are staying home, you should minimise contact with others.


### Do I need to quarantine after returning from Malaysia to Singapore?

Yes. Due to increase in Covid-19 cases in Malaysia, Singapore now imposes a 14-day SHN at SDFs. payable by the employer. The final cost arrangement between you and your employer will differ from company to company.


## Passport Renewal 


### Where can I renew my passport? 

You may refer to the [myPassport](https://eservices.imi.gov.my/myimms/myPassport?lang=en) service. Also see the Malaysian High Comm FAQ page [here](http://tinyurl.com/jervois301).


### My passport is expiring soon. What will happen to my Re-entry Permit? 

Your re-entry permit is fine as long as you do not leave Singapore while it is expired.

Once you have received your re-entry permit, please update ICA through [e-REP](https://www.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/erep).


### What if there are issues with my passport renewal?
