## What do I need to do to exit Singapore? {#exit-sg}

There are no restrictions for exiting Singapore. The official travel advisory by MOH is to defer all travel to Malaysia. The latest advisory can be found [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19).

Please verify that your Re-entry Permit (REP) is still valid before exiting Singapore. Additionally, please ensure that you have a digital copy of your REP on your phone or in cloud storage. You may obtain a copy of the REP [here][e-REP]

Regarding the issue of myPASS for travel to Malaysia, if you are travelling:

- **by land**: ICA should not be asking for a myPASS. If they do, inform them that the Malaysian side will not ask for myPASS on entry.

- **by air**: Airlines and immigration authorities may ask you to show your [myPASS/Travel Note](#mypass-necessary) because they liaise with the Malaysian High Comm. To be safe, please apply.

## What do I need to do to enter Malaysia? {#enter-my}

You will need to print out, fill in, and sign a [Letter of Undertaking](http://www.nadma.gov.my/images/nadma/documents/garispanduan/LATEST_LOU.pdf) stating that you agree to pay any quarantine costs applicable (accommodation and Covid-19 test). Leave the witness field blank.

You must also do a pre-departure swab test up to 3 days before your departure to Malaysia.

At least 3 working days before entering, you should also: 

1. download MySejahtera
1. make payment for all costs (accommodation, swab test, operational costs if foreigner) at [MySafeTravel] _(not recommended for now due to rule changes to MCO)_
1. ~~apply for a [myPASS](https://mypass.mhc.org.sg/)/Travel Note from the High Commission of Malaysia~~ _(practically optional, see [note below](#mypass-necessary))_
1. apply for home quarantine exemption if you qualify; see [here](#my-hso-at-home)

If you are entering the country with non-Malaysian citizen(s) (e.g. your spouse or children who holds non-Malaysian citizenship, and including those with Malaysian PR), see below: [What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Malaysia?](#enter-my-family-non-citizen)

If you are entering Sabah, please take note of the latest SOPs found on [this page](https://hednp.sabah.gov.my). Take note that non-Sabahans may need approval to enter the state; see more details [here](https://phednp.wixsite.com/website). Fill in the Health Declaration Form [here](http://sm.jknsabah.gov.my/HDF/hdf.php) within 12 hours of your arrival. 

If you are entering Sarawak, please take note of the latest SOPs found on [this page](https://sarawakdisastermc.com/). If you meet the requirements, you will need to [apply for enterSarawak](https://entersarawak.socoe.co/register) and fill in the Health Declaration Form [here](https://ms.microweb.my/) within 12 hours of your arrival.


## How can I enter Malaysia from Singapore via the land checkpoints? {#enter-my-transport}

If you have your own vehicle (car/motorcycle), you may head to either checkpoint during their operating hours.

Otherwise, you may only enter via BSI/Woodlands. You may choose to walk across the Causeway. 

Alternatively, you may use the shuttle bus arranged by the Johor government, chargeable at S$1 (note: cannot be paid with RM3, no change provided). They operate hourly from 7.30am to 6.30pm (except 1.30pm for lunch break). See [here](https://www.facebook.com/officialpaj/posts/3930626316950618) for timetable.

Take note of the operating hours at each checkpoint in Malaysia (BSI operates from 7am to 7pm; KSAB operates from 8am to 12am for light vehicles). The Singapore checkpoints operate 24 hours a day.


## What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Malaysia? {#enter-my-family-non-citizen}

From 11th October onwards, there are no restrictions for entering Malaysia.
<!--
If you are entering Malaysia with non-citizen(s) including those holding Malaysia PR, then you will need to apply for [MyTravelPass] for them to enter the country at least 14 days before your journey. Please submit your application only once and wait for a response on your application.

If the non-citizen traveller(s) do not have a [LTSVP][Acronyms] yet, also apply for an appointment slot at [STO][Sistem Temujanji Online] to apply for the LTSVP within 30 days of their arrival date. Proof of appointment slot is required on arrival; they risk being denied entry if it is not done.
-->
However, foreigners are required to make payment for the accommodation and operational costs using [MySafeTravel] before entering Malaysia.

## I am not leaving on the day stated on the myPASS / MyTravelPass / MySafeTravel, do I need to re-apply? {#my-enter-different-date}

The validity period will be stated on the document that you have applied for, including for any other travellers following you. 

Please re-apply for the passes if you are not travelling within the stated validity period(s).


## Is applying for myPASS still necessary? {#mypass-necessary}

So far, most anecdotes show that both Singaporean and Malaysian authorities do not check if you have a myPASS/Travel Note before exiting Singapore and entering Malaysia respectively. There is also no restriction of entry into Malaysia as a Malaysian citizen.

However, the directive to apply myPASS is given by the MHC, and airlines may still ask for a valid myPASS before travel.

If you want to err on the side of caution, you may apply. In the event of emergency travel or if you have not received your myPASS before you travel, the recommendation at the moment is to travel regardless and explain your situation to the authorities (if needed) that Malaysian citizens are not barred from re-entering Malaysia.


## Is there anything to do/note before entering Malaysia on the day of my travel? {#before-entering-my}

All travellers are now recommended to make payment for their accommodation, swab tests, and operational costs (for foreigners) with [MySafeTravel] before entering the country.

You must do a pre-departure swab test up to 72 hours before the start of your journey. See [here](#my-pre-entry-swab).

If you are a Malaysian citizen and choose not to pay in advance, please make sure you have sufficient cash with you to pay for all prevailing charges, especially the swab test which is payable by cash upon arrival (to be safe, bring at least RM400). Credit cards may not be accepted at checkpoints.

If you have been vaccinated and would like to apply for home quarantine, please do so 7-10 days ahead of your arrival; see [here](#my-hso-at-home) for more details.

Bring along the following with you:

1. a pen
2. a thermometer
3. a [digital][e-REP]/physical copy of valid SPR Re-entry Permit (REP)
4. the MySafeTravel receipt(s)/QR code(s) (if payment was made ahead of time)
5. cash of at least RM400 (if payment not made ahead of time)
6. a printed and signed Letter of Undertaking (LoU) (optional, can be filled on arrival)

Do not worry if you don’t have a MyPass, see: [Is applying for myPASS still necessary?](#mypass-necessary)

If you are travelling in via the land checkpoints, make sure that you are expected to reach the checkpoints while they are open. For BSI, the operating hours are 7am to 7pm; for KSAB, the operating hours are 8am to 12am. See also: [How can I enter Malaysia from Singapore via the land checkpoints?](#enter-my-transport)

You may want to pack some (dry) food for consumption while going through the procedures and during hotel quarantine.

Do not bring: 

1. drugs (unless for medical purposes - it’s recommended to bring along a doctor’s note/prescription)
2. drinking alcohol
3. cigarettes
4. sharp items

They will be confiscated by the team during bag checks and there is no guarantee that the items will be returned to you in their original condition.


## Do I need to do a swab test before entering Malaysia? {#my-pre-entry-swab}

Yes. You must do a pre-departure swab test up to 72 hours before you begin your journey to Malaysia. See the [press release][Press Release Ismail Sabri 24May].

Anecdotes mention that the land checkpoints have not enforced this. Skip the pre-departure swab test at your own risk of being denied entry.

## What are the procedures I can expect after entering Malaysia? {#after-entering-my-procedures}

At arrival, you will be cleared for immigration. You will also submit your LoU (if you’ve forgotten to bring it along, you can sign a copy on the spot). 

You will then be brought to a testing centre at fixed intervals. Those travelling in their own vehicles (car/motorcycle/van/…) will be escorted by police. For those entering via the land checkpoints by foot or public transport at BSI, there will be trips to the testing centre via bus at the same time.

At the testing centre, you will be swabbed and asked to wait for your test results. You may be informed that you can order food delivery services to the location.

If your test results are negative, you will then be brought to the hotel for check-in procedures. There, if you have not paid using [MySafeTravel](https://safetravel.myeg.com.my), you will pay for the prevailing hotel charges (currently at RM150/night), payable by credit card.

The total duration from arrival at immigration to hotel check-in can take anywhere from 5 hours up to 12 hours. Please prepare sufficient water, snacks, medication, etc.


## How much will the quarantine cost? {#my-hso-cost}

For normal accommodation, it will cost RM150/night.

Non-Malaysians also have to pay a fixed administrative cost of RM2600/person.

|  | 14 days quarantine | [21 days quarantine](#my-hso-duration) |
|-|:-:|:-:|
| Malaysian | First person:<br>RM2100<br><br>Second person:<br>RM700<br><br>Third person (6y/o and below):<br>free | First person:<br>RM3150<br><br>Second person:<br>RM1050<br><br>Third person (6y/o and below):<br>free |
| Non-Malaysian | First person:<br>RM2100 + RM2600 = RM4700<br><br>Second person:<br>RM700 + RM2600 = RM3300<br><br>Third person (6y/o and below):<br>RM2600 | First person:<br>RM3150 + RM2600 = RM5750<br><br>Second person:<br>RM1050 + RM2600 = RM3650<br><br>Third person (6y/o and below):<br>RM2600 |

_The "second person" only applies to: legally married spouse, children, and siblings._

Additional charges may apply if you opt for premium accommodation.

For swab tests, you will be swabbed on:
1. arrival,
1. the 10th day of your quarantine, and
1. the 18th day of your quarantine ([if extended](#my-hso-duration)).

|  | Swab test prices (14-day quarantine) | Swab test prices (21-day quarantine) |
|-|:-:|:-:|
| Malaysian | RM150 x 2 = RM300 | RM150 x 3 = RM450 |
| Non-Malaysian | RM250 x 2 = RM500 | RM250 x 3 = RM750 |


## How many days is the quarantine going to be? {#my-hso-duration}

14 days, with a potential extension to 21 days based on risk assessment done; see [press release][Press Release Ismail Sabri 24May].

## How do I know the last date of my quarantine? {#my-hso-last-day}

Follow the date on the wristband or on the papers issued to you on arrival.

## Can I choose which hotel to stay in? {#my-hso-choose-hotel}

You may put in a request with [APM](/appendix-acronyms) on the day of your arrival for your choice of hotel/room if:

1. You are returning in your own vehicle (i.e. not public transport); and
2. You have made prior arrangements (enquiry & booking, not payment) with the hotel of your choice.

On the day of your arrival, show the booking confirmation from the hotel to the APM officer on site (not JIM or MOH personnel) to show that they are willing to check you in.

See the known quarantine stations [here](/appendix-misc#hotels-hso). All arrangements are subject to hotel availability, and additional charges may apply depending on the location.


## Can I get food or personal items delivered to/from my hotel via Grab or by family members? {#my-hso-delivery-personal}

The SOPs on delivery differ from hotel to hotel. You are advised to check with the hotel directly.

The common SOP known is that for food delivery, only fast food is allowed. Home cooked food will not be allowed unless special approval is given by MOH (e.g. health reasons). 

For personal belongings (e.g. clothes), **please only do so if it is urgent and necessary.** Hotel workers are swamped with these requests. Family members can bring it over; however, you are not allowed to hand over any items (including any perishables and souvenirs) back to your family members or friends.


## Are there laundry services at my hotel? {#my-hso-laundry}

You are to stay in your room at all times. In general, most reports have said that laundry services are not provided. You may opt to do your own washing in your room.

## Can I choose to quarantine at home? {#my-hso-at-home}

You will qualify for home quarantine provided you meet the following criteria: 

- Fully vaccinated:
  - for double-dosed vaccines (e.g. Pfizer / Moderna / AstraZeneca / Sinovac), 14 days after second dose of vaccination; **or** 
  - for single-dosed vaccines (e.g. CanSinoBio / J&J), 28 days after vaccination
- Have a suitable place for quarantine (based on risk factors determined by MOH)
- Present a negative Covid-19 PCR test on arrival

If you meet the above criteria, you should complete the application form [here][HSO Application Portal] **7-10 days** prior to your arrival. Approval will take up to 7 working days.

Please submit fully the relevant supporting documents, including your vaccination certificate 

If your application is not processed by the time you arrive, it should be assumed that you must first quarantine at a hotel until you are approved to quarantine at home, and that [payment for quarantine](#my-hso-cost) will be made first, followed by a pro-rated refund after the home quarantine approval is given.

## I have taken the vaccine for Covid-19. Can I get an exemption for quarantine? {#hso-vaccine-exemption}

No. Even with the [new policy to quarantine at home](#my-hso-at-home), you must apply for exemption. There are currently no policies that automatically exempt those who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 from their quarantine obligations.


## There is an active MCO/PKP at my point of entry, can I still go back? {#enter-with-active-mco}

Yes, you can. 

## I would like to travel to another state/district after my quarantine ends (e.g. quarantine in Selangor after entering KLIA, but my hometown is in Perak). Can I do so? {#travel-after-mco}

Yes. Inter-state travel is allowed from 11th October 2021 onwards. However, please note that special requirements may still apply for entry into [Sabah](https://hednp.sabah.gov.my) and [Sarawak](https://sarawakdisastermc.com/).
<!--
Yes. Take note that inter-state travel is not allowed for the whole country, and states under MCO will not allow inter-district travel.

You should make arrangements to travel home on your own, if possible.

If you have difficulties travelling home on your own, your family will have to apply for a movement permit using the [CMCO / PKPB][Movement Permit CMCO] form. Physical copies of the form are available at the nearest police station, or can be printed using the above link.

Please send to your friends/relatives photos of these documents to support the movement permit application:

1. the Quarantine Order document given to you at the start of the quarantine
2. (If applying last minute) the _Surat Pelepasan_

The police will have to approve your family's movement permit, after which your family/friends must then carry the letter when they pick you up from the quarantine station at the end of your quarantine.
-->

## Can I be exempted from paying the quarantine fees? {#my-hso-payment-exemption}
