## Passport Renewal 


### Where can I renew my passport? 

You may refer to the [myPassport](https://eservices.imi.gov.my/myimms/myPassport?lang=en) service. Also see the Malaysian High Comm FAQ page [here](http://tinyurl.com/jervois301).


### My passport is expiring soon. What will happen to my Re-entry Permit? 

Your re-entry permit is fine as long as you do not leave Singapore while it is expired.

Once you have received your re-entry permit, please update ICA through [e-REP](https://www.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/erep).


### What if there are issues with my passport renewal? 

Follow the instructions at the Malaysian High Comm FAQ page [here](http://tinyurl.com/jervois301).
