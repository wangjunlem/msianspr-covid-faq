## Passport Renewal 

### Where can I renew my passport? 

You may refer to the [myPassport] service. Also see the Malaysian High Comm FAQ page [here][MHC FAQ].

[This page](http://foodwinetravelmore.com/how-to-renew-malaysian-passport-in-singapore/) is a good guide to the application process. _Credits to the blog owner! :)_

### My passport is expiring soon. What will happen to my Re-entry Permit? 

Your re-entry permit is fine as long as you do not leave Singapore while it is expired.

Once you have received your renewed passport, please transfer your re-entry permit through [e-REP].


### What if there are issues with my passport renewal? 

Follow the instructions at the Malaysian High Comm FAQ page [here][MHC FAQ].
