## Emailing MOH MY for Special Consideration of Hotel Quarantine Exemption 

<p class="has-text-danger">
<b>NOTE:</b> Please understand that in almost all cases, unless there are truly extenuating circumstances, you will <b>NOT</b> be granted exemption from quarantine.
</p>
<p class="has-text-danger">
Unless there is a need (<b>NOT</b> a want), please be more understanding, and do not take up unnecessary time and resources from MOH appealing with ridiculous and selfish reasons (i.e. you want to spend quarantine at home with your family for leisure).
</p>
