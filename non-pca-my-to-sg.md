## What do I need to do to exit Malaysia? 

If you are a SPR and travelling alone or with other long-term pass holders, you will have to show your long-term pass(es) - SG NRIC or FIN - to the immigration officers. Please also prepare a copy of your REP in case they ask for it. 

You do not need a MyTravelPass at the moment (see [announcement (video) by DGI](https://youtu.be/oRNEHKjrel4?t=323), [JIM FB post](https://www.facebook.com/imigresen/posts/3576029612463468), [response from enquiry to MyTravelPass](/appendix-response-jim)); however, please check official sources before your travel date to ensure that this is still true on the date of your departure. If in doubt and if you have time, it is recommended to apply for [MyTravelPass](https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/main?) approval 5 working days before your date of departure.

Note that holding SPR In-Principle Approval (IPA) does not constitute being a PR, so you will need to apply for a MyTravelPass to exit.

If you are travelling with others, see: [What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Singapore?](#what-if-my-spousechildren-are-going-over-with-me-to-singapore)


## What do I need to do to enter Singapore? 

You will need to submit a [Health Declaration](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/) up to 3 days before your arrival in Singapore.

You will need to pay for your swab test (up to $200 including GST). Payment will not be made at the border; register and follow the instructions [here](https://go.gov.sg/covid19test). You will be informed of the date of your swab test later.

If you are entering Singapore with a non-SC/non-SPR, please ensure that they have approval from the relevant authorities for entry into Singapore. See the ICA page for more information [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/enteringsg). 

From 27 November 2020 onwards, to enter Singapore, non-SC/non-SPR travellers will also require a valid negative RT-PCR COVID-19 swab test within 72 hours before departure to Singapore. See [press release](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updated-border-measures-for-travellers-from-malaysia-and-japan) and [info sheet](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) for more details.

## How can I enter Singapore from Malaysia via the land checkpoints? 

If you have your own vehicle (car/motorcycle), you may head to either checkpoint during their operating hours.

Otherwise, you may only enter via Woodlands/BSI. You may choose to walk across the Causeway. 

Alternatively, you may use the shuttle bus arranged by the Johor government, chargeable at RM1.50 (no change provided). They operate hourly from 7am to 6pm (except 1pm for lunch break). See [here](https://www.facebook.com/officialpaj/posts/3930626316950618) for timetable.

Take note of the operating hours at each checkpoint in Malaysia (BSI operates from 7am to 7pm; KSAB operates from 8am to 12am for light vehicles). The Singapore checkpoints operate 24 hours a day.


## I entered Malaysia after 18 March 2020 (first day of MCO). Can I still exit Malaysia now? 

Yes, with the condition that you hold a valid Singapore PR or long-term pass. Otherwise, you will need to apply for approval to exit the country via [MyTravelPass](https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/main?).

_You are strongly advised to not abuse this, please, and to only travel if absolutely necessary._


## Can I serve my SHN at my residence in Singapore? 

No. You must serve a [14-day SHN](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updated-border-measures-for-travellers-from-malaysia-and-japan) at a SHN dedicated facility, including any RGL travellers. For normal travellers, all prevailing costs for tests and accommodation apply. (If you are travelling under RGL, please check with the authorities, but the likelihood is that you will have to pay for the prevailing costs as well.)

## What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Singapore? 

If you are exiting the country with Malaysian citizen(s) who do not qualify for any approval exemptions listed in the JIM memo [here](https://www.facebook.com/imigresen/posts/3525366314196465) (latest as of 7th October 2020; please check JIM page in case this becomes outdated), then you will need to apply for [MyTravelPass](https://mtp.imi.gov.my/myTravelPass/main?) for them to exit the country at least 5 working days before your journey. Include all relevant supporting documents - your SPR NRIC and reentry permit, marriage/birth certificates, and an appeal letter at the bare minimum. Please submit your application only once until there is a response on your application.

You will also need to [submit an appeal](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e3648e9405c180011dc5f9c) to ICA for entry to Singapore for people not holding SPR. From 27 November 2020 onwards, non-SC/non-SPR travellers will also require a valid negative COVID-19 to enter Singapore. See [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updated-border-measures-for-travellers-from-malaysia-and-japan) for more details.

When exiting Malaysia, the current rule is that you (as the SPR) must exit together with any travellers under 12 who have gained the special approval on MyTravelPass.


## Is there anything to do/note before I enter Singapore? 

Please remember to keep all receipts during your SHN, including any taxi rides, as they might be needed for contact tracing if your swab test returns a positive result.

Please ensure that you have a thermometer with you to monitor your health during SHN.

There is a regular hourly bus offered by the Johor government. See [here](#how-can-i-enter-singapore-from-malaysia-via-the-land-checkpoints).

All related costs (tests, SHN, medical fees if any) will no longer be waived by the Singapore government if you enter after 1 January 2021. See [here](https://www.gov.sg/article/cost-of-shn-stays-swab-tests-and-medical-expenses-when-you-travel) for the latest updates on cost, and [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-to-stay-home-notice-and-charging-policy-for-travellers) for the change in policy.

You may want to download TraceTogether and/or SingPass, as well as the StayHome@SG app.

If you are driving into, or passing through any districts/states with any form of MCO in effect, please apply for a movement permit using the form [here](https://www.rmp.gov.my/docs/default-source/Penerbitan/borang-permit-pergerakan-pkpb.pdf?sfvrsn=2) at the nearest police station. This applies to travellers departing from KLIA/KLIA2 as well. See: [Known Areas Affected By MCO](/appendix-mco)

## How long is the SHN going to be? 

14 days at a SHN dedicated facility. See [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updated-border-measures-for-travellers-from-malaysia-and-japan) for the latest update.

## How much will the entirety of the SHN cost? 

For staying at a SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF), it will cost $2000 per person. If you are sharing the room with another person (limited to family members and subject to approval), the cost will be $1300 per person.

If you have children, they may qualify for reduced charges depending on their age. You can appeal to ICA via the hotel in which you are serving your SHN; the hotel manager on duty will forward the appeal.

For the swab test, it will cost less than $200 per person. (Last known price: $125)


## What happens to my vehicle if I’m driving in? 

You will not be parking the car at the SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF). Instead, you will have to drive to a car park you have arranged beforehand (e.g. HDB/condo), and then head to the SDF.

There have been instances of escort officers and vehicles that will follow you to the car park and then bring you back to the SDF, There are also stories of being given a tracker, heading to the car park yourself, and then getting a taxi back to the SDF. Please follow the instructions of the officers on the day itself.


## When is my swab test? 

You will be contacted via SMS and phone regarding your swab test up to 2 days before the actual day of the swab test. From experience, the swab test will take place 3-4 days before the end of your SHN.


## When and where can I check my swab test results? 

Your swab test result will be available on [HealthHub](https://eservices.healthhub.sg/PersonalHealth/CovidLabResults) within 24 hours of the test. You will also be contacted by phone.


## What happens at the end of my SHN? 

First, please verify the end date of your SHN using the calculator provided [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn) at the end of the page.

You can leave your accommodation after 12pm on the last day of your SHN, but only if your Covid-19 test results are out.


## Do I throw away the wristband and gateway at the end of my SHN? 

You can throw away the wristband after the end of SHN.

There will be arrangements made to collect the gateway one day before the end of your SHN.
