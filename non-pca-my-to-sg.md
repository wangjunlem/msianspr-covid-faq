## What do I need to do to exit Malaysia? {#exit-my}

If you are a SPR and travelling alone or with other long-term pass holders, you will have to show your long-term pass(es) - SG NRIC or FIN - to the immigration officers. Please also prepare a copy of your REP in case they ask for it. 

You do not need a MyTravelPass to exit Malaysia if you hold a valid, full-fledged PR. Note that holding only the In-Principle Approval (IPA) does not constitute being a PR, so you will need to apply for a MyTravelPass to exit.

If you are travelling with others, see: [What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Singapore?](#enter-sg-non-pr)

## What do I need to do to enter Singapore? {#enter-sg}

You will need to submit a [Health Declaration](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/) up to 3 days before your arrival in Singapore.

You will also require a valid negative RT-PCR COVID-19 swab test result within 48 hours before departure to Singapore. See [here](#sg-pre-entry-swab) and [info sheet](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) for more details.

You will need to pay for your swab tests (up to $200 per swab, including GST). For the swab test on arrival, please follow the instructions [here][SafeTravel Swab]. For the swab tests on the 14th day of SHN, payment will not be made at the border; register and follow the instructions [here](https://go.gov.sg/covid19test). You will be informed of the exact dates of your swab tests later.

If you are entering Singapore with a non-SC/non-SPR, please ensure that they have approval from the relevant authorities for entry into Singapore. See the ICA page for more information [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/enteringsg). 

## How can I enter Singapore from Malaysia via the land checkpoints? {#enter-sg-transport}

If you have your own vehicle (car/motorcycle), you may head to either checkpoint during their operating hours.

Otherwise, you may only enter via Woodlands/BSI. You may choose to walk across the Causeway. 

Alternatively, you may use the shuttle bus arranged by the Johor government, chargeable at RM1.50 (no change provided). They operate hourly from 7am to 6pm (except 1pm for lunch break). See [here](https://www.facebook.com/officialpaj/posts/3930626316950618) for timetable.

Take note of the operating hours at each checkpoint in Malaysia (BSI operates from 7am to 7pm; KSAB operates from 8am to 12am for light vehicles). The Singapore checkpoints operate 24 hours a day.


## I entered Malaysia after 18 March 2020 (first day of MCO). Can I still exit Malaysia now? {#exit-my-after-mco}

Yes, with the condition that you hold a valid Singapore PR or long-term pass. Otherwise, you will need to apply for approval to exit the country via [MyTravelPass].

_You are strongly advised to not abuse this, please, and to only travel if absolutely necessary._

## I have taken the vaccine for Covid-19. Can I get an exemption for SHN? {#shn-vaccine}

No. There are currently no policies that exempt travellers from Malaysia who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 from their SHN obligations.

## Can I serve my SHN at my residence in Singapore? {#shn-own-home}

No. You must serve a [14-day SHN][MOH SG 4May Presser] at a SHN dedicated facility, including any RGL travellers. For normal travellers, all prevailing costs for tests and accommodation apply. (If you are travelling under RGL, please check with the authorities, but the likelihood is that you will have to pay for the prevailing costs as well.)

## What if my spouse/children are going over with me to Singapore? {#enter-sg-non-pr}

If you are exiting the country with Malaysian citizen(s) who do not qualify for any approval exemptions listed in the JIM memo [here](https://www.facebook.com/imigresen/posts/3525366314196465) (please check JIM page in case this becomes outdated), then you will need to apply for [MyTravelPass] for them to exit the country at least 14 days before your journey. Include all relevant supporting documents; the bare minimum would be 
- your Singapore PR NRIC(s)
- your Singapore PR re-entry permit(s) _(a copy of it can be obtained [here][e-REP])_
- marriage/birth certificates
- an appeal letter

Please submit your application only once until there is a response on your application.

You will also need to submit an appeal to ICA for entry to Singapore for people not holding SPR; see [here](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/scpr-familial-ties-lane/requirements-and-process) for more info. They will also require a valid negative COVID-19 to enter Singapore. See [here][MOH Presser SHN MY 14d] for more details.

When exiting Malaysia, the current rule is that you (as the SPR) must exit together with any travellers under 12 who have gained the special approval on MyTravelPass.

## Is there anything to do/note before I enter Singapore? {#before-entering-sg}

Please remember to keep all receipts during your SHN, including any taxi rides, as they might be needed for contact tracing if your swab test returns a positive result.

Please ensure that you have a thermometer with you to monitor your health during SHN.

You must do a pre-departure swab test and get a negative result within 48 hours before entering Singapore. See [here](#sg-pre-entry-swab).

There is a regular hourly bus offered by the Johor government. See [here](#enter-sg-transport).

All related costs (tests, SHN, medical fees if any) will no longer be waived by the Singapore government. The latest updates on cost can be found at the links for [SHN Dedicated Facilities][SafeTravel SDF] and [swab tests][SafeTravel Swab].

You may want to download TraceTogether and/or SingPass, as well as the StayHome@SG app.

If you are driving into, or passing through any districts/states with any form of MCO in effect, please apply for a movement permit using the form [here][Movement Permit CMCO] at the nearest police station. This applies to travellers departing from KLIA/KLIA2 as well.

## Do I need to do a swab test before entering Singapore? {#sg-pre-entry-swab}

Yes. All travellers will need to present a valid negative PCR test within 48 hours before departing for Singapore. See [here][MOH SG Pre-Depart Presser] for the update.

## How long is the SHN going to be? {#shn-duration}

14 days at a SHN dedicated facility. See [here][MOH SG 4May Presser] for the latest update.

## How much will the entirety of the SHN cost? {#shn-cost}

For staying at a [SHN Dedicated Facility][SafeTravel SDF] (SDF), it will cost $2000 per person for 14 days. If you are sharing the room with another person (limited to family members and subject to approval), the cost will be $1300 per person.

If you have children, they may qualify for reduced charges depending on their age. You can appeal to ICA via the hotel in which you are serving your SHN; the hotel manager on duty will forward the appeal.

For the [PCR swab tests][SafeTravel Swab], it will cost maximum $200 per person per swab. (Last known price: $160 for arrival swab, $125 for swab at end of SHN)

For the ART test kits, you will be charged $40 for 4 kits.

## What happens to my vehicle if I’m driving in? {#vehicle-before-shn}

You will not be allowed to park the car at the SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF). Instead, you will be asked for the car park you wish to park your vehicle at, and the ICA officers will give you a tracker, as well as the car plate of the taxi that will be waiting for you on arrival. You will then have to drive to the car park. Board the aforementioned taxi, and then head to the SDF. You will return your tracker afterwards.

Please follow the instructions of the officers on the day itself. Note that any car park charges will be borne by you.


## When are my swab tests? {#swab-when}

You will be required to take a swab test [before departure](#sg-pre-entry-swab) and on arrival. This rule applies to all travellers.

On days 3, 7, and 11, you will be required to do a swab test by yourself, using the ART test kits provided to you.

You will also complete a PCR swab test on the last day of your SHN.

## When and where can I check my swab test results? {#check-swab-results}

Your swab test results will be available on [HealthHub](https://eservices.healthhub.sg/PersonalHealth/CovidLabResults) within 24 hours of the test. You will also be contacted by phone.

## What happens at the end of my SHN? {#shn-end}

First, please verify the end date of your SHN using the calculator provided [here](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/shn-calculator) at the end of the page.

You can leave your accommodation after 12pm on the last day of your SHN, but only if your Covid-19 test results are out.
