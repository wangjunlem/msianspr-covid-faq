## Does the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) apply to us SPRs?

Yes, if you are employed by a company. Please consult with your companyâ€™s HR on the exact procedures.

See more information about the PCA scheme [here][SafeTravel].


## What are the travel requirements, conditions, restrictions?

You must travel in and out via the land borders (i.e. Woodlands/BSI and Tuas/KSAB).

While waiting for your swab test results on entry to Malaysia, you must have a place of residence in the state of Johor, if not, you will need to arrange for a hotel room to stay. If your Malaysia IC does not reflect it, please show proof of residence (e.g. bank statements or bills).

You can be out of Singapore for up to 60 days per PCA application, and will have to be back in Singapore for another 90 days before you can submit another PCA application.

The total number of PCA travellers per day is subject to a daily quota (unknown number). Please make arrangements with your employer ahead of time.


## I am self-employed/unemployed. Am I allowed to apply for PCA?

No. The application for PCA requires the company to apply for you with a CorpPass account.


## Do I need to quarantine after returning from Singapore to Malaysia?

You will need to quarantine for the first 3 days while waiting for results. During this time, even if you are staying home, you should minimise contact with others.


## Do I need to quarantine after returning from Malaysia to Singapore?

Yes. Due to increase in Covid-19 cases in Malaysia, Singapore now imposes a 14-day SHN at SDFs. payable by the employer. The final cost arrangement between you and your employer will differ from company to company.
