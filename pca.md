## Does the Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) apply to us SPRs? {#pca-spr-qualify}

Yes, if you are employed by a company. Please consult with your companyâ€™s HR on their stance on PCA and the exact procedures for application.

See more information about the PCA scheme [here][SafeTravel] and the requirements and process [here][PCA Requirements and Process].

## What are the travel requirements, conditions, restrictions? {#pca-travel-conditions}

You must travel in and out via the land borders (i.e. Woodlands/BSI and Tuas/KSAB).

You must strictly follow the date agreed to return to Singapore as specified in your PCA application. See [here](#pca-date-change).

While waiting for your swab test results on entry to Malaysia, you must have a place of residence in the state of Johor, if not, you will need to arrange for a hotel room to stay. If your Malaysia IC does not reflect it, please show proof of residence (e.g. bank statements or bills).

You can be out of Singapore for up to 60 days per PCA application, and will have to be back in Singapore for another 90 days before you can submit another PCA application.

The total number of PCA travellers per day is subject to a daily quota (unknown number). Please make arrangements with your employer ahead of time.


## I am self-employed/unemployed. Am I allowed to apply for PCA? {#pca-no-corppass}

No. The application for PCA requires the company to apply for you with a CorpPass account.


## Do I need to quarantine after returning from Singapore to Malaysia? {#pca-my-hso}

You will need to quarantine for the first 3 days while waiting for results. During this time, even if you are staying home, you should minimise contact with others.

## Do I need to do a swab test before returning to Malaysia? {#pca-my-swab}

No. You will be swabbed on arrival in Malaysia, and placed under quarantine while waiting for the swab test results.

## Do I need to quarantine after returning from Malaysia to Singapore? {#pca-sg-shn}

Yes. Due to increase in Covid-19 cases in Malaysia, Singapore now imposes a 14-day SHN at SDFs. payable by the employer. The final cost arrangement between you and your employer will differ from company to company.

## Do I need to do a swab test before going back to Singapore? {#pca-sg-swab}

No, PRs are exempt from the pre-departure swab test.

However, you will undergo a swab test at the end of your SHN. If you are entering from 25th January onwards, you will also take a swab test on arrival.

## Is it possible to stay in the same room for SHN with other people? {#pca-sg-shn-share}

Yes, but only if the person is a family member (spouse/child who does not need to be under PCA). Please prepare proof of familial ties, such as a copy of the marriage/birth certificate.

Employees from the same company are no longer allowed to share rooms.

See the [response][ICA SafeTravel Response] from the Safe Travel team on costs and appeal details.

## I would like to travel on a different date from the dates in the PCA application. Am I allowed to do so? {#pca-date-change}

No, you must travel on the dates that were mentioned. 

No amendments are allowed once the PCA application is approved. The PCA pre-payment for SHN and swab will be forfeited and not refunded. A new PCA application can only be done 90 days after your last entry date.

You may still [exit to Malaysia](/non-pca-sg-to-my) and [re-enter Singapore](/non-pca-my-to-sg) without the PCA, subject to the conditions and process as a non-PCA traveller.
